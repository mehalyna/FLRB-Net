# Integration of a Fuzzy Rule-Based Microservice in .NET for Real-Time Cyber Threat Monitoring with Interpretable Risk Ratings

Abstract. We present an architecture and prototype implementation of a high-performance .NET microservice that produces interpretable, real-time risk scores for cyber events by combining word-embedding vectors, Random Forest feature selection, classical ML classifiers and a fuzzy rule-based (FLRB) inference engine. The system is designed for operational use in Security Operations Centers (SOC) and to integrate with existing SIEM pipelines. Key contributions include a reproducible data pipeline from raw text logs to mood/feature vectors, an automated genetic-algorithm method for synthesis of compact and interpretable fuzzy rule bases, engineering patterns for low-latency .NET hosting, and a set of evaluation results addressing detection accuracy, scoring interpretability and runtime scalability.

Background and motivation. Modern SIEMs increasingly adopt machine learning and AI to augment signature and rule-based detection, yet operations teams require interpretable outputs to act quickly. Next-generation SIEMs rely on ML to reduce noise and surface actionable anomalies, therefore integrating interpretable scoring that can explain risk drivers is essential for trust and remediation. ([hunters.security][1]) Classical supervised models such as SVM and Random Forest are strong baseline detectors for text-based indicators when combined with robust features derived from word embeddings. Studies show that word-embedding representations can capture semantic signals in network and log data, while Random Forest remains effective at selecting informative components from those vectors. ([ResearchGate][2]) Fuzzy rule-based inference adds robustness to partial, noisy inputs and provides human-readable rules that map feature patterns to risk levels.

Method overview. The proposed pipeline has four logical stages. Stage 1 performs tokenization and vectorization of textual fields from logs, alerts and tickets using WordVec/Word2Vec or equivalent embedding models to produce dense vector representations that encode semantics of messages. Stage 2 applies Random Forest feature importance ranking to reduce dimensionality, identify the most discriminative embedding components and produce a compact vector of key features for downstream models. Stage 3 runs fast classifiers (SVM or Random Forest) to provide a primary anomaly/prediction signal and feature-level confidences. Stage 4 applies an FLRB module that takes the compact feature vector and classifier outputs, evaluates a curated set of fuzzy rules and produces a scalar risk rating together with an explanation in the form of activated linguistic rules. The FLRB rule base is synthesized and tuned offline using a genetic algorithm that optimizes both score accuracy and rule compactness, then shipped to the microservice as a deployable, versioned rule artifact. Evidence from the literature supports the practical use of genetic algorithms for automatic synthesis and tuning of fuzzy rule bases across control and classification domains. ([dspace.chmnu.edu.ua][3])

FLRB design and rule synthesis. We represent each fuzzy antecedent as a linguistic variable with parameterized membership functions. Candidate rules are encoded as chromosomes and evolved to maximize an objective that balances predictive performance on labeled incidents and interpretability constraints such as rule length and feature coverage. Genetic operators include crossover that mixes antecedent sets, mutation that perturbs membership parameters and tournament selection that favors compact, robust rules. Prior works demonstrate that genetic synthesis achieves compact, well-performing rule sets in noisy environments, making this approach suitable for security telemetry where labels are limited and noisy. ([dspace.chmnu.edu.ua][3])

Implementation notes in .NET. The microservice is implemented as an ASP.NET Core application exposing a low-latency HTTP/REST and gRPC API for ingestion and query. The service has two deployable components. A lightweight inference container exposes endpoints for single-event risk scoring and returns both numeric score and an explanation (the top activated fuzzy rules and their firing strengths). A separate offline orchestration container handles batch retraining, rule synthesis via the genetic algorithm and packaging of the new FLRB artifact. Fuzzy logic functionality can be implemented using existing .NET libraries such as Accord.Fuzzy and open implementations of fuzzy inference, or by calling performant native libraries such as fuzzylite via interop when stricter performance is desired. ([NuGet][4]) To enable fast classification, the SVM/RF models are exported in ONNX and consumed via onnxruntime .NET bindings for consistent, low-latency inference.

Operational integration and data engineering. For production readiness the microservice integrates with SIEM and streaming platforms. Ingest is handled through a message bus (Kafka or Event Hubs) with schema validation and lightweight pre-processing. A connector ingests enriched SIEM events, extracts textual fields, and pushes them to the vectorization worker. Scoring results and explanations are forwarded to the SIEM as JSON payloads and inserted into the incident index, enabling correlation with other telemetry and automated playbooks. The architecture supports both synchronous scoring for analyst workflows and asynchronous bulk scoring for nightly enrichment. Best practices for SIEM integration emphasize non-blocking ingestion, idempotent message processing and clear provenance metadata for each score. ([Lansweeper][5])

Generative AI for data augmentation. Real cyber incident labels are scarce, so we use controlled generative models to synthesize realistic log messages and attack narratives for training and stress tests. Large language models and conditional sequence generators can produce diverse attack variants that expand training coverage. Recent empirical work shows LLM-based augmentation can improve detection performance when combined with classical ML baselines, provided synthetic data is validated for realism and label fidelity. ([Nature][6]) We keep augmentation in offline pipelines and gate synthetic data with human review before use in production models.

Evaluation strategy. The evaluation suite measures detection quality, interpretability, latency and throughput. Detection quality uses standard classification metrics such as precision, recall and AUC on held-out incident datasets. Interpretability is assessed by (a) rule compactness, (b) percent of incidents explained by top-k rules and (c) analyst ratings on whether explanations make remediation actions clearer. Latency targets aim for sub-50 ms median per-event scoring for synchronous calls at modest scale, and throughput targets align with peak SIEM ingestion rates via horizontal scaling. We run load tests using realistic event streams to measure CPU, memory and p99 latency and tune batch sizes and model quantization accordingly.

Scalability and robustness. The microservice is containerized and deployed using Kubernetes with autoscaling based on observed CPU and request latency. The inference tier is stateless and horizontally scalable, while rule artifacts are mounted from a versioned object store enabling quick rollbacks. To handle noisy or missing inputs the FLRB gracefully degrades by using partial rule matching and returning an uncertainty measure, which improves operator trust compared with opaque single-score outputs.

Security, governance and explainability. All model artifacts and rule versions are auditable. The service logs feature attributions and rule firings for each scored event into a secure index for audit and post-incident analysis. Governance includes an approval pipeline for deploying new rule sets, and periodic human-in-the-loop review of rules that materially change scoring behavior.

Discussion and future directions. The proposed FLRB microservice bridges model performance and human interpretability, making it a practical addition to SOC toolchains. Future work includes continuous online adaptation of rules using streaming GA updates, tighter orchestration with detection playbooks, and richer multimodal inputs (binary telemetry, network flows) for hybrid fuzzified scoring. There is also potential to open a two-way feedback loop from analysts to the genetic rule synthesizer so that domain knowledge can be incorporated directly into the evolutionary prior.

Conclusions. Combining WordVec embeddings, Random Forest feature selection, fast classifiers and an evolved fuzzy rule base yields a practical, interpretable risk-scoring microservice that fits into modern .NET-centric enterprise stacks and SIEM ecosystems. The proposed architecture balances accuracy, explainability and latency, and supports operational governance processes required by enterprise SOCs.
